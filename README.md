# Vectors
practising basic java console app

App asks for inserting two vectors with int values. Simply write some numbers to create one vector:
4 5 65 2 44
Confirm the end of the vector with ENTER. Size of the vector is optional.

App adds vectors if they are the same size. Otherwise throws a WektoryRoznejDlugosciException which keeps size of each vector, and asks for inserting these vectors again.
